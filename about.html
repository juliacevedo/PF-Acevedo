                    Hypnos, Latin Somnus, Greco-Roman god of sleep. Hypnos was the son of Nyx (Night) and the twin brother of Thanatos (Death). In Greek myth he is variously described as living in the underworld or on the island of Lemnos ( according to Homer) or (according to Book XI of Ovid’s Metamorphoses) in a dark, musty cave in the land of the Cimmerians, through which flowed the waters of Lethe, the river of forgetfulness and oblivion.
                    HYPNOS was the god or personified spirit (daimon) of sleep. He dwelt in Erebos, the land of eternal darkness beyond the gates of the rising sun, and rose into the sky each night in the train of his mother Nyx (Night). Hypnos was often paired with his twin brother Thanatos (Peaceful Death), and the Oneiroi (Dreams) were his brothers or sons.

                    Hypnos was depicted as a young man with wings on his shoulders or brow. His attributes included either a horn of sleep-inducing opium, a poppy-stem, a branch dripping water from the river Lethe, or an inverted torch.
                    Hypnos was not one of the more commonly worshipped gods, but he was important. He is most often depicted as a gentle young man with wings coming from his temples or shoulders. He is the brother of Thanatos, a nature god who was the personification of death.

                    Hypnos and Thanatos lived in the Underworld, in a cave where neither sunlight nor moonlight would enter. The entrance to this cave was surrounded by poppies, which can make people fall asleep.
                    Hypnos' other family members include his mother Nyx, goddess of night, and his father Erebus, god of darkness. He was married to Pasithea, a goddess of relaxation and hallucination. So, what do you get when you combine sleep and hallucination? Hypnos and Pasithea had three sons called the Oneiroi, which is Greek for the Dreams. One son could take human form in people's dreams, one was the personification of nightmares, and one made fake dreams full of illusions.

            In Greek mythology, Hypnos (/ˈhɪpnɒs/; Ancient Greek: Ὕπνος means 'sleep') 
            also spelled Hypnus is the personification of sleep; the Roman equivalent is known as Somnus. 
            His name is the origin of the word hypnosis. Pausanias wrote that Hypnos was a dearest friend of the Muses.
            Hypnos was depicted as a young man with wings on his shoulders or brow. 
            His attributes included either a horn of sleep-inducing opium, a poppy-stem, 
            a branch dripping water from the river Lethe (Forgetfulness), or an inverted torch.
